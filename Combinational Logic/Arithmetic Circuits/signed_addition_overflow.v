	/*
    To detect signed overflow when adding two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, you can use the fact that overflow occurs in the following cases:

When adding two positive numbers produces a negative result.
When adding two negative numbers produces a positive result.
For two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit. So, overflow can be detected by comparing the sign of the result (s[7]) with the signs of the input numbers (a[7] and b[7]).

If both a[7] and b[7] are 0 (i.e., both numbers are positive) but s[7] is 1 (i.e., the result is negative), overflow occurred.
If both a[7] and b[7] are 1 (i.e., both numbers are negative) but s[7] is 0 (i.e., the result is positive), overflow occurred.
    s = a + b; computes the sum of a and b.
The overflow detection expression (~a[7] & ~b[7] & s[7]) | (a[7] & b[7] & ~s[7]) works as follows:
(~a[7] & ~b[7] & s[7]) checks for the case where both a and b are positive (i.e., a[7] and b[7] are 0), but the result s is negative (s[7] is 1).
(a[7] & b[7] & ~s[7]) checks for the case where both a and b are negative (i.e., a[7] and b[7] are 1), but the result s is positive (s[7] is 0).
This logic will correctly detect signed overflow in 2's complement add
